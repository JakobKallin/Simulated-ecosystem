Simulated-ecosystem
===================

Simulated ecosystem, a BSc project at Chalmers University of Technology

Our objective is to design and implement a system for simulating an ecosystem, with populations that can both grow and evolve. We’re going to focus on the predator-prey model, and manipulate the basic model with different factors. This will be done by e.g. changing the shape of the inhabited universe, or adding new species. We will analyze the result and try to draw conclusions from them. The following questions are of particular interest:

    How does the geometric shape of the inhabited area affect the species within it?
    How does the size of the area affect the species within it?
    How much can you limit (shrink) the area before species will be severely affected or extinct?
    How does the ecosystem change when a new species is added?
    How does the ecosystem change when an existing population is greatly increased/decreased or totally removed?


If we can answer the questions above, we may have a clue about what would happen if the same thing occurred in a more complex, real life situation. If we find some interesting behaviour or pattern, we hope that our results might apply to a corresponding situation in nature, or at least be a subject for further studies.

Similar systems exists today, but we also want the program to be modular, so that it easily can be extended to model different systems, e.g. mathematicians and biologists should be able to simulate their own ecosystem models. Other students who simply are interested in ecosystems should also be able to use our software. With this in mind, we will make the program as user friendly as possible.
